Introduction
This project implements a facial recognition system for automating student attendance. It includes an anti-spoofing mechanism to ensure that photographs or videos cannot be used to trick the system. The system captures real-time video feeds from a camera, detects faces, and verifies them against a pre-trained model. If the face is recognized and verified as live, the attendance is marked automatically.

Features
Real-time facial recognition
Anti-spoofing mechanism to detect and reject fake faces
Automatic attendance marking
User-friendly interface for easy management
Secure and efficient database for storing attendance records
Installation
Prerequisites
Python 3.7 or higher
OpenCV
TensorFlow or PyTorch
Dlib
Flask (for web interface)
SQLite or any other preferred database
Configuration
You can configure various settings in the config.py file:

Camera settings
Database configurations
Model paths
Anti-spoofing parameters
Dataset
For training the facial recognition and anti-spoofing models, you can use publicly available datasets such as:

LFW (Labeled Faces in the Wild)
CelebA
CASIA-FASD
Ensure to follow the respective terms and conditions for each dataset.

Model Training
Face Recognition Model:

Use a pre-trained model or train your own using frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
Follow tutorials on training facial recognition models for more details.
Anti-Spoofing Model:

Use datasets like CASIA-FASD to train models that can differentiate between real and fake faces.
Follow tutorials on training anti-spoofing models for more details.
